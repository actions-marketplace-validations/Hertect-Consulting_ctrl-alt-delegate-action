# Ctrl Alt Delegate

[![CI](https://github.com/Hertect-Consulting/ctrl-alt-delegate-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hertect-Consulting/ctrl-alt-delegate-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Checks the instruction files your AI coding agents follow and fails the pull request when they're wrong. Free for any repo.

## Install

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ctrl-alt-delegate.yml
name: Ctrl Alt Delegate
on: pull_request
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Hertect-Consulting/ctrl-alt-delegate-action@v1
```

`fail-on` sets what fails the check: `all` (default), `dead-only` (dead command and dead path findings only), or `none` to report without going red. `paths` adds extra instruction-file globs to discover, on top of the built-in list below.

## What it checks

Four checks, each a finding with file, line, and one sentence:

1. **Dead command.** A Check or What line backticks a command nothing defines. Finding: `` Dead command: `buildit` — no package.json script, Makefile target, or CI workflow binary named `buildit`. ``
2. **Dead path.** Applies to, What, or Check names a path or glob matching nothing at the head commit. Finding: `` Dead path: `src/legacy/**` matches no files at the head commit. ``
3. **No Check line.** A rule with an empty or missing Check, or a heading-style rule with no command and no path anywhere in it. Finding: `` No Check line: "Keep the build current" has an empty or missing Check. ``
4. **Contradiction.** Two files set a different Check for the same purpose (test, lint, build, typecheck), or state a different version for the same tool (Node, Python, Go). Finding: `` Contradiction: the test Check here is `npm test`, but `pnpm test` (CLAUDE.md) says otherwise. ``

One sticky PR comment, grouped by check, updated on each run — never a new comment per run.

## What it reads

These instruction files, at the pull request's head commit:

- `AGENTS.md` (root and nested)
- `CLAUDE.md`, following one level of `@import`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc` and `.cursorrules`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `**/SKILL.md`

## When it flags something

CAD holds every rule to the same five-line shape:

```
What: One plain sentence.
Applies to: A path or glob.
Check: A command that passes, or something visible in the PR.
Owner: @handle
Reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
```

If you can't write the Check line, the rule is a wish, not a rule. Starter files in each of the five kinds are in [`templates/`](templates/) — copy the one you need and edit it. The code in this repo is MIT licensed; the templates are CC BY 4.0.

## What it never does

Writes to your repo, opens PRs, rewrites your rules, sends your data anywhere, looks at other repos, or keeps state between runs.

## Notes

- If your GitHub organization restricts Actions to verified creators, add `Hertect-Consulting/ctrl-alt-delegate-action` to the allow list first: Organization Settings → Actions → General → Policies.
- Pull requests from forks get a read-only token, so CAD can't post a PR comment there — it writes findings to the job summary instead. Same-repo PRs still get the sticky comment.
